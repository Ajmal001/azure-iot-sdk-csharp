## Contribute code or documentation
Our SDKs are open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug and maybe adding your name to our commit history :) Please mention any relevant issue number in the pull request description.

We require pull-requests for code and documentation to be submitted against the `master` branch in order to review and run it in our gated build system. We try to maintain a high bar for code quality and maintainability, we insist on having tests associated with the code, and if necessary, additions/modifications to the requirement documents.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.

**If your contribution is going to be a major effort, you should give us a heads-up first. We have a lot of items captured in our backlog and we release every two weeks, so before you spend the time, just check with us to make sure your plans and ours are in sync :) Just open an issue on GitHub and tag it as "contribution".**

## Review Process
We expect all guidelines to be met before accepting a pull request. As such, we will work with you to address issues we find by leaving comments in your code. Please understand that it may take a few iterations before the code is accepted as we maintain high standards on code quality. Once we feel comfortable with a contribution, we will validate the change and accept the pull request.

Thank you for any contributions! Please let the team know if you have any questions or concerns about our contribution policy.
